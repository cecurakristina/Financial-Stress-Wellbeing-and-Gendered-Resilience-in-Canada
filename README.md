# Financial Stress, Wellbeing, and Gendered Resilience in Canada

**Do two incomes buy what one did?**  
This capstone project examines how economic security and wellbeing have shifted across generations in Canada, with a focus on gender differences and resilience. It combines quantitative data analysis with psychological theory to explore how financial pressures affect mental health and how gendered inequalities persist in the modern workforce.

## Research Questions

1. How has the real purchasing power of the median Canadian household changed from the 1970s–1990s to today when adjusting for cost of living?  
2. Today, after controlling for education and job factors, how does financial stress relate to self-reported mental health?  
3. Do women report similar job satisfaction as men within the same occupation despite earning lower wages and facing greater objective burdens, consistent with the idea that resilience may mask exploitation?

## Goals

1. **Assess changes in economic security over time** by analyzing how real purchasing power and housing affordability have evolved for Canadian households.  
2. **Examine how financial stress relates to wellbeing** by testing associations between income and self-reported mental health.  
3. **Investigate gender differences in pay, workload, and satisfaction** to explore whether women’s resilience masks structural inequalities.  
4. **Propose evidence-informed policy solutions** such as improved leave policies, pay transparency, and measures to reduce financial and psychological strain to promote wellbeing and equity in the workplace.

> **Note:** Due to time constraints, the current analysis focuses on income, wage gaps, and housing affordability. Future work will expand on RQ2 to explore financial pressures, mental health, job satisfaction, and gendered resilience in more depth.
